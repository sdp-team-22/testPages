# Website
[Currently hosting from simpleMockup_1 branch](https://sdp-team-22.github.io/website/)

So, website hosting works. We can host from sdp repository directly too.
It only works for public repositories though, so maybe we can connect this public repo frontend to private backend? (not sure how to do this yet)
